# The Thread Pulled Apart: A Housewife's History

From the quiet corner of my small home, by the flickering oil lamp, I witnessed the world shift. They say history is written in battles and decrees, but I know it's etched just as deeply in the lines on a woman's face, the silence in a child's laughter, and the ever-present ache in a mother's heart. This is not the grand saga of kings and empires, but the humble, sorrowful chronicle from my threshold.

## The Beginning: A Simple Promise

I was married off with blessings and hopes. A promising match, they said. My husband, Raghunath, was a man of quiet strength, a loyal soul tied to the land and his duty. Our small house was built brick by patient brick, holding the promise of simple joys â€“ the smell of bhakri on the hearth, the sound of children's voices echoing in the courtyard, the shared peace of evening prayers. We dreamt of healthy sons, daughters married well, abundant harvests, and a life lived in quiet dignity under the protection of our King, Shivaji Maharaj, and later, his brave son.

We were taught loyalty, faith, and the importance of our Maratha homeland. We believed in the cause, in the ideal of Swarajya. We tended our fields, raised our families, and sent our men when the call came, secure in the belief that we were building a better future, a safe future, for our children.

## The Gathering Clouds

But the world outside our village walls grew restless. Whispers of the Emperor's growing might, of battles fought far away, began to creep into our lives. The demands increased. Men were needed for the army, supplies taken for the war effort, taxes levied heavily.

Raghunath, like many others, had to leave. Not just during the harvest, but for weeks, sometimes months, to join the King's forces. Each departure was a knot tightening in my stomach. The home, once a shared haven, became my sole responsibility, along with the mounting fear. The children would ask, "When is Baba coming back?" and I'd smile, trying to keep my voice steady, while my heart felt heavy as stone.

The simple promise of peace began to fray.

## The Price Paid

Living like this became a perpetual state of waiting. Waiting for news. Waiting for Raghunath. Waiting for the next demand. Our harvests became less certain, the market prices volatile. Sickness seemed to cling more easily to bodies weakened by worry and poor nutrition.

We buried our youngest daughter, taken by a fever that a few years prior, we might have afforded medicine for. Raghunath wasn't here. He was fighting somewhere, for us, for the King, for the dream of Swarajya. My sorrow was a solitary burden, heavy with the unspoken question: Was this the price? Was this the cost of the freedom we yearned for?

When Raghunath returned, he was often thinner, his eyes holding a weariness that went deeper than physical exhaustion. The lightheartedness we once shared was replaced by a quiet tension. The war had marked him, just as it had marked our home, our village, our very souls.

## The Weight of Each Day

The sadness wasn't always a dramatic wail; often, it was the quiet despair of everyday life. Cooking with less, mending clothes worn thin, comforting a child terrified by the sound of distant drums, seeing the fear reflected in the faces of other women in the village. The communal life that once offered solace was now bound by shared anxiety and loss.

We held onto hope like a fragile thread. Our hope was in Maharaj Sambhaji. He was young, brave, the Chhaava â€“ the lion's cub â€“ who had stepped into his mighty father's shoes. We believed he would protect us, that his strength would finally bring the peace we craved. Every prayer was a plea for his safety, for his victory. He carried not just the weight of the kingdom, but the hopes and dreams of every simple household like mine.

## The Silence Fell

Then came the news.

It wasn't a messenger with a fanfare; it was a chilling silence that spread through the village faster than any rumour. Men gathered with grim faces, women clasped their hands over their mouths, tears streaming down cheeks. Maharaj... taken. Captured by the Emperor's forces.

The world stopped.

The news wasn't just political; it was a deeply personal catastrophe. He was our King, the one we had sacrificed for, prayed for, pinned all our future on. His fate felt like the shattering of that initial, simple promise made on my wedding day. The promise of a safe, stable future.

Later, the details trickled in â€“ the cruelty, the unimaginable suffering he endured. Each whispered word was a hammer blow to the heart. Our King, our brave Maharaj, treated with such barbarity. It wasn't just his life that was brutally ended; it felt like the death of hope itself for countless people like us.

## Living with Ghosts

The sadness remains, a permanent resident in our home. Raghunath is home now, but changed forever. We go through the motions of life, planting, harvesting, raising our remaining children. But the laughter is quieter, the future feels uncertain, and the shadow of what was lost hangs heavy.

The sacrifices, the waiting, the fear, the tears shed â€“ they all culminated in this profound, enduring sorrow. We continue because we must, for our children. But the bright promise of the beginning was pulled apart, thread by painful thread, by the harsh realities of a world that demanded everything and left behind only the memory of what might have been, and the deep, quiet ache of a housewife's history.
